# Optionally, you can add a table of contents to your post.
# NOTES:
#   - make sure that TOC names match the actual section names
#     for hyperlinks within the post to work correctly.
#   - we may want to automate TOC generation in the future using
#     jekyll-toc plugin (https://github.com/toshimaru/jekyll-toc).
toc:
  - name: Equations
    - name: Stacking Regression 
    # if a section has subsections, you can add them as follows:
    # subsections:
    #   - name: Example Child Subsection 1
    #   - name: Example Child Subsection 2
  - name: Citations
  - name: Footnotes
  - name: Code Blocks


# Below is an example of injecting additional post-specific styles.
# If you use this post as a template, delete this _styles block.

**NOTE:**
This is a footnote 


## Equations


Here we are able to put some MathJax3 maths into the blog post
$$
    \frac{2f}{6} = 11 \le 12
$$

### Stacking Regression

And here we will put the function for stacking regression

$$
    \hat w^{st} = \argmin_w \sum_{i=1}^N \left[ y_i - \sum_{m=1}^M w_m \hat f_m^{-i} (x_i) \right]^2,
$$


***

## Citations

And I am able to cite myself <d-cite key="paul2020"></d-cite>, and it should appear at the bottom. 


***

## Footnotes

<d-footnote>And this will appear as a footnote.</d-footnote>

***

## Code Blocks


An example of inline code snippets: `<d-code language="r">df <- data.frame(1:20)</d-code>`.


<d-code block language="python">
for i in range(0,20):
    print(i)
</d-code>
